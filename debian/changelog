ros-indigo-rosserial-server (0.6.2-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Bugfix for interrupted sessions.
    This is a two-part fix for an issue causes a segfault when the device
    disappears during operation, for example a ttyACM device which is unplugged.
    The AsyncReadBuffer part avoids calling a callback after the object
    owning it has destructed, and the SerialSession part avoids recreating
    itself until the previous instance has finished the destructor and been
    full destroyed.
  * Add dependency on rosserial_msgs_gencpp, fixes #133 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/issues/133>
  * Make ServiceClient::handle public, to fix compilation bug on some platforms.
  * Enabled registration of service clients
  * Add namespaces to headers, swap ROS thread to foreground.
  * Move headers to include path, rename to follow ROS style.
