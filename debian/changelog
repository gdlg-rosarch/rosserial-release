  * Implementation of native UDP rosserial server. (#231 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/issues/231>)
  * Explicit session lifecycle for the serial server. (#228 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/issues/228>)
    This is a long overdue change which will resolve some crashes when
    USB serial devices return error states in the face of noise or other
    interruptions.
  * Support for VER1 protocol has been dropped.
  * Handle log messages in rosserial_server

  * Fill out description field in package.xml.
  * Bugfix for checksum.
    Publishing topics fails when messages are over 256 bytes in length due to checksum() function or'ing high and low byte instead of adding them.
  * rosserial_server: Properly receive messages > 255 bytes.

  * Bugfix for interrupted sessions.
    This is a two-part fix for an issue causes a segfault when the device
    disappears during operation, for example a ttyACM device which is unplugged.
    The AsyncReadBuffer part avoids calling a callback after the object
    owning it has destructed, and the SerialSession part avoids recreating
    itself until the previous instance has finished the destructor and been
    full destroyed.
  * Add dependency on rosserial_msgs_gencpp, fixes #133 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/issues/133>
  * Make ServiceClient::handle public, to fix compilation bug on some platforms.
  * Enabled registration of service clients
  * Add namespaces to headers, swap ROS thread to foreground.
  * Move headers to include path, rename to follow ROS style.
